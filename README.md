# My3DGame
 
I have been developing this game alone with Unity, C#, Blender and Photoshop, it took me quite a while and it is now testable. I would #really appreciate some feedback of things that I could improve, change and I would also love you hear the aspects you like about it.

The game concept is that you need to push out other players from a platform up in the sky using fireballs and other magic spells. The #minimum amout of players to play this game is 2. It's a 3D game.

An alpha version can be downloaded on my website here: http://christopherj-002-site1.gtempurl.com/

#Let me know another site i can upload it too if you feel like its unsafe to have it on my public website.

I am a webprogrammer but I started learning game development as I developed this network based game. : ) Thanks for reading. I'll add a #comment section to my website soon too.
